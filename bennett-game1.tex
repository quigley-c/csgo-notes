Game 1; Infernoi
Ct Start
R1 \$800 - save - dies, loss
static holding coffin - dies

In the replay here he fires his first bullet before he even moves the mouse. When he does move the mouse it looks
like he's trying to track to the target but he's moving the mouse too slow to catch it as it moves across the screen.
