Game 1; Inferno
R1 \$800 - save - dies, loss
static holding coffin - dies

Bennett does a couple things wrong when fighting. The first is his ADADAD pattern. He clearly
understands the idea: Strafe and counter-strafe to switch direction and fire a bullet when you're stopped,
but his timing off, so he's usually moving when he fires. The second thing is that he doesn't flick to a target.
In the replay here he fires his first bullet before he even moves the mouse. When he does move the mouse it looks
like he's trying to track to the target but he's moving the mouse too slow to catch it as it moves across the screen.
(not flicking, read aim guide)

Everything seems fine about this round other than to be aware that there is usually more than 1 person pushing
on a B execute, and to be ready for multiple enemies.
