\subsection{Bennett}

\subsubsection{Overview}
His greatest strength is his utility use. Bennett consistently finds ways to use smokes and
molotovs to pressure the enemy team and he isn't afraid to experiment with smokes to find interesting
and useful 1 ways or chokes. That said, he has quite a few issues when fighting toe-to-toe with enemy
players.

In Genereal, he does a couple things wrong when fighting. The first is his ADADAD pattern. He clearly
understands the idea: Strafe and counter-strafe to switch direction and fire a bullet when you're stopped,
but his timing off, so he's usually moving when he fires. The second thing is that he doesn't flick to a target.
(see: aim guide)

I think he should prioritize putting himself in situations where he can push aggressively
with a teammate to ensure a trade.
\subsubsection{Strengths}
Utility, holding angles

\subsubsection{Weaknesses}
aim, awareness

\subsubsection{Recommended Positons}
support, entry fragger

\subsubsection{Extra Notes}
I think in general Bennett plays really passive T side. His weaker aim probably
leads him to avoid duels and engagements that may be necessary to execute agressive T
side attacks. (see: trading)
