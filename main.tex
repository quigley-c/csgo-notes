\section{CS:GO Notes}

\begin{figure}
	This document describes my basic understanding of how to play the game. This includes information
	such as what options are strongest in certain situations (eg. enemy AWP watching a long sightline).
	This was inspired by an idea I had to treat my teammates as RPG characters to 'deploy' them
	in situations where their strong points are advantaged. The second half of this document deescribes
	my observations of the strengths and weaknesses of each member of our team.

\section{Teammate Observations}

\begin{figure}
	This section describes my observations of my teammates decision making during a match. This data is collected
	by re-watching the matches we play as a group and noting each decision the player makes, as well as the outcome
	of that decision. The goal is to establish a clear picture of each player's strengths and weaknesses to both
	identify points that should be worked on for improvement and to understand what situations each member of the
	team is strong in so we can have them in those positions as often as possible.
