\section{CS:GO Notes}

\begin{figure}
	This document describes my basic understanding of how to play the game. This includes information
	such as what options are strongest in certain situations (eg. enemy AWP watching a long sightline).
	This was inspired by an idea I had to treat my teammates as RPG characters to 'deploy' them
	in situations where their strong points are advantaged. The second half of this document deescribes
	my observations of the strengths and weaknesses of each member of our team.

\section{AIM FOR DUMMIES}

One thing I find generally helpful to keep in mind when aiming is to literally take my time with my shots. This has a couple
meanings, but most importantly it means that before I ever consider firing a bullet, I am going to confirm that my cursor is
all the way over to where I want it to be and that i'm not moving before I fire. Generally, the faster you can confirm that
your crosshair is correctly placed, the faster you can fire. So the whole motion takes the time of aiming and confirming your
target. Keep in mind that it feels like aiming takes a long time, and not to get hasty. It takes longer to aim an accurate shot
than it does to aim an inaccurate one. This means that you'll actually spend less time fighting overall however, since you will
be hitting more shots and killing your opponent more efficiently. When done quickly this looks like a flick.

\section{Guidelines. Strategies, and Gameplay Techniques}

\subsection{Holding Angles}
Generally, static holding angles is bad unless you've got a scope, improving your lethality at range due to better accuracy.

Generally, if you're confident at range with your weapon you can static hold angles more effectively, but the real reason is
peaker's advantage.

If you're static holding an angle and your opponent peaks you, they have the advantage. But if you peek-
unpeak an angle, you have a chance to peak after your opponent has pushed out, giving you peaker's advantage.

\section{Teammate Observations}

\begin{figure}
	This section describes my observations of my teammates decision making during a match. This data is collected
	by re-watching the matches we play as a group and noting each decision the player makes, as well as the outcome
	of that decision. The goal is to establish a clear picture of each player's strengths and weaknesses to both
	identify points that should be worked on for improvement and to understand what situations each member of the
	team is strong in so we can have them in those positions as often as possible.
